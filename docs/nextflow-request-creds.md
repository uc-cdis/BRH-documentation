# **Request Credentials for Uploading a Docker Container**

*Please copy and paste the email template below into a new email and send to [brhsupport@datacommons.io](mailto:brhsupport@datacommons.io). Please be sure to add the relevant information to the bolded fields.*

Hello, User Services,

Please create new temporary AWS credentials to permit me to upload a Nextflow container.

The email address I use to log in to BRH is: **[BRH login email here]**

I understand that these credentials will last for 1 hour, once created. If I continue to need access to upload after they expire, I will request new credentials.

Since the credentials will ONLY last 1 hour after creation, you may prefer we send them at a certain time of day. Please **delete which of these do NOT apply**:

* Please generate and send my credentials tomorrow morning
* Please generate and send my credentials in the afternoon
* Please generate and send my credentials ASAP

To ensure prompt attention, I will also ping `@Sara Volk de Garcia` on the Slack channel after I have sent my email.

Thanks!

**[your name]**
