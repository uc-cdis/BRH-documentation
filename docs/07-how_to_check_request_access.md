# **How To Check and Request Access**

Users can find out to which projects they have access to by navigating to the [Discovery Page][BRH Discovery] and by selecting through the column filters at the top of the table.

## Access to individual Studies

You can check access by clicking on a study in the Discovery Page, as shown below:

The Study Page will display access permissions in the top right corner. Click the “Permalink” button in the upper right to copy the link to the clipboard.

If you have access, a green box will show “You have access to this study”.

Access is displayed as a green box on top of each Study Page.

Note: If you have access but cannot select the study to export to workspace, it is because the manifest is not yet available. Please use API for these cases.

## Authorize to Gain Access to FAIR-enabled Repositories/Resources

BRH securely provides access to data stored on multiple FAIR repositories, resources, and Data Commons.

**Users must authorize these resources on their account in order to:**

1. *run* Jupyter Notebooks that utilize data stored in various FAIR repositories.
2. *export* data that is stored in FAIR repositories from the Discovery Page to the Workspaces.
3. *download* data that is stored in FAIR repositories from the Discovery Page.

In order to authorize access to these repositories and data commons, navigate to the [Profile Page][Profile page]. Authorize the relevant commons by clicking on the buttons for the relevant commons (e.g., the Refresh or Authenticate buttons in the image shown below).

Authorization needs to be renewed after 30 days, as indicated after "Status: expires in [..] days".
