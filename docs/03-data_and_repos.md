# **Data and Repositories**

The BRH securely exposes study metadata and data files stored on multiple FAIR repositories and Data Commons, *i.e.* data libraries or archives, to provide an easy way to connect different repositories on one single location.

FAIR data repositories are traditionally a part of a larger institution/working group established for research, data archiving, and, to serve data users of that organization.

As of March 2023, the list of currently shared resources/Data Commons on BRH includes:

* BioData Catalyst
* CRDC Cancer Imaging Data Commons
* CRDC Genomic Data Commons
* CRDC Integrated Canine Data Commons
* CRDC Proteomic Data Commons
* IBD Commons
* JCOIN
* MIDRC
* NIAID ClinicalData
