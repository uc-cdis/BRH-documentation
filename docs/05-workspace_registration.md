# **Register for Workspaces**

To start exploring BRH Workspaces right away, users can apply for a temporary trial access to BRH workspaces, or extended access to BRH workspaces using NIH STRIDES. Extended access to BRH Workspaces is granted using the NIH STRIDES workspace account, and takes a few weeks to be fully approved. Please see below for more details.

## Guidelines for Temporary Trial Access to BRH Workspaces

For new users without workspace access, please follow these steps

1. Login to [BRH][BRH login]
2. Click on [workspace tab][BRH Workspace]. That opens a workspace registration form
3. Fill in the details and submit the form shown below.

5. Users should receive an email notifying them that the request has been received.

6. Once the temporary trial request is approved, users will get another email notifying them of approval. They should be able to access the workspace then. The timeline for approval is typically a few days.

## Guidelines for Extended Access to BRH Workspaces using STRIDES

The workspace account is handled with the help of **NIH STRIDES** (NIH **S**cience and **T**echnology **R**esearch **I**nfrastructure for **D**iscovery, **E**xperimentation, and **S**ustainability). The NIH STRIDES Initiative allows NIH to explore the use of cloud environments to streamline NIH data use by partnering with commercial providers.

By leveraging the STRIDES Initiative, NIH and NIH-funded institutions can begin to create a robust, interconnected ecosystem that breaks down silos related to generating, analyzing, and sharing research data.

NIH-funded researchers with an active NIH award may take advantage of the STRIDES Initiative for their NIH-funded research projects. Eligible researchers include NIH intramural researchers and awardees of NIH contracts, other transaction agreements, grants, cooperative agreements, and other agreements. More information on NIH STRIDES and how to gain access can be found [here][STRIDES]. Please see below for registration steps

1. Users will receive an invitation via email to register for an NIH STRIDES workspace account. Users can click the link in the invitation email or start requesting a workspace account by visiting https://brh-portal.org/ and logging in.

2. After authorization, users will see the landing page, which displays current workspace accounts and credits once workspaces access and credits/grants have been approved.

      To start the process of requesting a new workspace account, users need to select "Request New Workspace" on the landing page.

      *For information on the NIH STRIDES options, please refer to the [official page]*[STRIDES].

    * The **STRIDES Grant/Award Funded** form can be selected if researchers have received NIH funding (e.g. a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction agreement) and intend to use these funds for the BRH account. With this option, the researchers' organization will be responsible for payment.

    *  The **STRIDES Credits** form can be selected if users are requesting credits from the NIH STRIDES Initiative for the BRH account. With this option, once the request is approved, a new account with a spending limit of $XXX will be provisioned for usage.

4. Submit the request. Note that the process of granting access for a workspace account can take up to two weeks and users will be notified. Following the approval, users will see the current workspace accounts and credits on the landing page.
