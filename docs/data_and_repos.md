# ** Data and Repositories **

The BRH securely exposes study metadata and data files stored on multiple FAIR repositories and Data Commons, i.e. data libraries or archives, to provide an easy way to connect different repositories on one single location.

FAIR data repositories are traditionally a part of a larger institution/working group established for research, data archiving, and, to serve data users of that organization.

The list of currently shared resources/Data Commons on BRH are accessible [_here._](https://brh.data-commons.org/dashboard/Public/list_of_commons.html)
