# **Tutorial Nextflow workflows - no containers**

## Example Nextflow notebooks

We have a collection of notebooks using Nextflow in Gen3 here: [https://github.com/uc-cdis/bio-nextflow/tree/master/nextflow_notebooks](https://github.com/uc-cdis/bio-nextflow/tree/master/nextflow_notebooks)

For this section, you will be most interested in the general Nextflow notebooks that do not use containers at all. You can find those here:

* [non_containerized_nextflow_workflows](https://github.com/uc-cdis/bio-nextflow/tree/master/nextflow_notebooks/non_containerized_nextflow_workflows)
