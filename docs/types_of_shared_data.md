# Types of Shared Data

The BRH provides secure access to study metadata from multiple resources (Data Commons) and will be the driving engine for new discovery. The types of data represented are diverse and include scientific research across multiple disciplines.

The BRH aims to make data more accessible by following the "FAIR" principles:

**F**indable
Researchers are provided an intuitive interface to search over metadata for all studies and related datasets.
Each study and dataset will be assigned a unique, persistent identifier.
Accessible

**A**uthenticated users can request and receive access to controlled-access data by data providers.
Metadata can be accessed via an open API.

**I**nteroperable
Data can be easily exported to various workspaces for analysis using a variety of software tools.

**R**eusable
Data can be easily reused to facilitate reproducibility of results, development and sharing of new tools, and collaboration between investigators.
