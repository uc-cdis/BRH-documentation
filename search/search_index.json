Guideline to get started in Workspaces \u00b6 Once users have access to workspaces, use this guide below to get started with analysis work in workspaces. Users need to log in via https://brh.data-commons.org/login to access workspaces. After navigating to https://brh.data-commons.org/workspace , users will discover a list of pre-configured virtual machine (VM) images, as shown below. (Generic) Jupyter Notebook with R kernel: Choose this VM if you are familiar with setting up Python- or R-based Notebooks, or if you just exported one or multiple studies from the Discovery Page and want to start your custom analysis. Tutorial Notebooks: Explore our Jupyter Notebook tutorials written in Python or R, which pull data from various sources of the Biomedical Research Hub to leverage statistical programs and data analysis tools.

Only files saved in the /pd directory will remain available after termination of a workspace session. Attention: Any personal files in the folder \u201cdata\u201d will be lost. Personal files in the directory /pd will persist. Do not save files in the \"data\" or \u201cdata/brh.data-commons.org\u201d folders. The folder \u201cbrh.data-commons.org\u201d in the \u201cdata\u201d folder will host the data files you have exported from the Discovery Page. Start a new notebook under \u201cNotebook\u201d in the Launcher tab. Click the tiles in the launcher and choose between Python 3 or R Studio as the base programmatic language. Note: You can open and run multiple notebooks in your workspace. However, the generic, tutorial and nextflow workspace images are currently separate docker images, so there is no functionality to combine them or run nextflow in the tutorial or generic images. This may be available in the future, after further testing and development activities. Experiment away! Code blocks are entered in cells, which can be executed individually or all at once.

Please Note: The process for granting access for a workspace account can take 2-4 weeks for NIH STRIDES , and a month for Direct Pay . The account from each different paymodel will have its own workspace storage directory ( /pd ); data is not shared between accounts with different funding types . However, you can import and export data among accounts as long as they are active and have funding. Request Trial Access \u00b6 Trial Access is granted for 2 months when you request access to the BRH Workspace page. The instructions for requesting workspace access are on the Workspace Registration page . Note that your trial access will become inactive as soon as you have a workspace account funded through a persistent paymodel. Requesting Funding for Workspace Accounts Through Any Persistent Pay Model \u00b6 Users can request a workspace account by visiting the BRH Workspace Account Manager at https://brh-portal.org/ and logging in. Some users may receive an invitation via email to register for an NIH STRIDES workspace account. Users can also click the link in the invitation email to get to the BRH Workspace Account Manager . In the BRH Workspace Account Manager, users can see their persistent workspace accounts and any available credits or funds in the accounts. If you only have trial access, you will not see any active accounts. To request a workspace account with a persistent paymodel, click the \"Request New Workspace\" button. Choose from any of the 3 persistent pay model funding options: a) STRIDES Grant/Award Funded; b) STRIDES Credits; or c) OCC Direct Pay to request a funded workspace account. OCC Direct Pay Funded Workspace Account \u00b6 The OCC Direct Pay form can be selected if a user wants to pay with a personal or organizational credit card. OCC Direct Pay only requires a valid credit card. Funding a workspace account with OCC Direct Pay has 2 major parts: Request BillingID Use BillingID to provision Direct Pay funds for the Workspace Account Request BillingID \u00b6 Note: It can take up to a month to receive a BillingID if you act promptly to complete each step. Go to https://payments.occ-data.org or click on the Payment Portal link on the OCC Direct Pay tab for the workspace account request form. Create an account for the OCC Payment Portal: Under Create Account, enter your email address and click \u201cRequest Token\u201d. Note: This should be an email address you check regularly, as relevant alerts will be sent here. You will receive an email with a 6-digit token within a couple minutes of your request. It may go to spam, so watch the Spam folder, as well. Copy your token from your email. Paste it into the Enter Token field on the OCC Payment Portal. Click Sign In. Successful sign-in will open a Profile page for your account on the OCC Payment Portal. When you first create your account on the payment portal, you will not have any access requests.

If you don't have an institutional affiliation, you can put \"independent data analyst\" Once the form is submitted, a message will appear indicating successful submission. You will also receive an email (again, check spam). If you return to the Profile page in the OCC Payment Portal now, you\u2019ll see there is an active request in the table at the bottom. Click \u201cCheck Status\u201d to view progress on the steps toward final approval and provisioning of your request. You can view what happens at each stage of processing here: https://payments.occ-data.org/processing-stages/ . When you click Check Status, you can see the progress of your request. At first, you will see that they are processing your request (indicated by an orange color). Once OCC finishes processing your access request, you will receive 2 emails, and the progress tracker at the bottom will show that Submit Access Request is completed (green). Complete E-Doc is now colored orange. The first email indicates that your access request status has progressed, and the second email has a link to an electronic document. Important: Review the Agreement carefully to understand the terms. PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE SIGNING! This document presents the terms governing how your Direct Pay funds will be allocated, among other things. Be sure you understand all the terms before you sign and submit. If you have any questions or concerns about the terms and conditions, please email billing@occ-data.org before you sign. Once you submit the signed document, it could take up to 5 days to finish processing receipt of the signed document and update your progress tracker. You will receive an email when processing is complete. But, you will receive an email quickly confirming that the document has been signed and providing a link to download the signed document for your records. If you do not receive that within 5 minutes (be sure to check your spam folder), please return to the document and verify that you fully signed and submitted the document. Please save the document so you can reference it as needed. When your request has been fully approved, the \u201cReceived Approval\u201d step will be green, you\u2019ll receive an email, and your BillingID field will have been populated on the Profile page of the OCC Payment Portal. You may now use your BillingID to provision a Direct Pay workspace account in BRH. Use BillingID to provision Direct Pay funds for the Workspace Account \u00b6 Note 1: Before you request a workspace account through any persistent pay model (eg, Direct Pay, STRIDES), be sure to backup all data in your /pd for your workspace. Once your persistent pay model is funded, you will no longer have access to the /pd used during blanket billing. ( What\u2019s a /pd ? ) Note 2: It can take up to 12 business days to provision funds from a BillingID. Copy your BillingID from your User Profile page in the OCC Payment Portal. Return to the Workspace Account Manager , and click Request New Workspace to open the Workspace Account Request Form . Click the OCC Direct Pay tab. Paste your BillingID in the field, and enter the first 3 characters of the email address associated with your BillingID (For example, if your email was john.smith@gmail.com, you would enter \u201cjoh\u201d) Click Confirm BillingID. Once your BillingID is confirmed, the bottom part of the form will open to allow you to enter the details for provisioning your account. Be sure to check the box that says that you agree to be invoiced. The amount of the invoice is taken from the value you entered when you made your access request on the Payment Portal . Enter a title for your project and a brief summary. This is to be used to help you keep track of your requests in case you have multiple accounts for different projects. Identify whether your workspace use is personal or organizational. Indicate whether you have a credit card you are allowed to use to pay for provisioning the workspace account. If your workspace is personal and you have any credit card, the answer will be yes. If your workspace is organizational - make sure you are not using a departmental card or similar without permission. Indicate what role you have as a researcher on this project. Once you submit this form, you will receive an email with the invoice. (It can take up to 5 business days to be sent.) There will be a secure link in the invoice to submit your credit card information and pay the invoice. When you pay the invoice, OCC will apply the funds, create an AWS account for this project\u2019s workspace, and send that information to BRH to provision your account. This can take up to 7 business days after you have signed the form. You will receive an email when your account is set up and ready to be used in your workspace. When you submit this form, you will also see a new entry in the OCC Direct Pay Accounts table in the Workspace Account Manager . The request status for your request will be Pending until the invoice is paid and the account is finalized. Once your Direct Pay request is funded, your workspace will be shown as Active on the Request Status column in the Workspace Account Manager . STRIDES Grant/Award Funded Workspace Account \u00b6 The STRIDES Grant/Award Funded form can be selected if researchers have received NIH funding (e.g. a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction agreement) and intend to use these funds for the BRH workspace account. With this option, the researchers' organization will be responsible for payment. Submit the request form. Note that the process of granting access for a workspace account can take 2-4 weeks and users will be notified by email. Following approval, users will see the provisioned workspace account in the BRH Workspace Accounts Manager . STRIDES Credits Funded Workspace Account \u00b6 Select the STRIDES Credits form to request credits from the NIH STRIDES Initiative for the BRH Workspace account. With this option, once the request is approved, a new account with a set spending limit of will be provisioned by NIH directly for usage. Submit the request form. Note that the process of granting access for a workspace account can take 2-4 weeks and users will be notified by email. Following approval, users will see the provisioned workspace account in the BRH Workspace Accounts Manager . What is the NIH STRIDES Initiative? \u00b6 The NIH STRIDES initiative (NIH S cience and T echnology R esearch I nfrastructure for D iscovery, E xperimentation, and S ustainability) can provide funding for BRH Workspace Accounts. The NIH STRIDES Initiative enables researchers with NIH grants to cost-effectively leverage the use of cloud environments by partnering with commercial providers, such as Amazon Web Services. By leveraging the STRIDES Initiative, NIH and NIH-funded institutions can begin to create a robust, interconnected ecosystem that breaks down silos related to generating, analyzing, and sharing research data. NIH-funded researchers with an active NIH award may take advantage of the STRIDES Initiative for their NIH-funded research projects. Eligible researchers include NIH intramural researchers and awardees of NIH contracts, other transaction agreements, grants, cooperative agreements, and other agreements.

For OCC Direct Pay, the soft limit is set in accordance with your Direct Pay User Agreement (signed during Direct Pay BillingID setup). Hard Limit: This is the limit at which a workspace VM will be immediately terminated and the workspace account will be shut down such that no VMs can be launched with it. For STRIDES accounts, users can edit this column to set the threshold at which the account becomes inactive. For OCC Direct Pay, the hard limit is set in accordance with your Direct Pay User Agreement (signed during Direct Pay BillingID setup).

You will not have access to your /pd folder. You will still be able to open the BRH Workspace page , and log in to the Workspace Account Manager . You can request new account funding from the Workspace Account Manager . Is the persistent directory (/pd) shared among all the pay model options? Will my data be available in all my workspace accounts? \u00b6 No. Currently, the /pd folder is separate for each workspace pay model account. So, the data from your /pd for your trial access account will not automatically be available in the /pd for your Direct Pay workspace account or your STRIDES workspace account. How should I cite research done in BRH workspace? \u00b6 Make sure to cite the author of the data used in your research, the repository housing the data, and the BRH platform enabling your access to the data. See details here . Direct Pay workspace, Payment Portal, & BillingID questions \u00b6 Why does my Hard Limit not match the amount of funding I purchased? \u00b6 As described in your Direct Pay User Agreement, some amount of your purchase is set aside for use for account operational expenses beyond compute costs. If you have further questions about this, please contact billing@occ-data.org Can I get a refund on any unused compute funding I purchased? \u00b6 Unfortunately, as described in your Direct Pay User Agreement, OCC cannot offer refunds for unused compute time already purchased. I've been using my workspace all day, but my total usage number hasn't changed at all. \u00b6 Data usage is monitored by AWS, and AWS makes updates several times a day. This means that you can possibly use the workspace for a number of hours before the compute usage is updated. Also, the update is sometimes delayed -- that is, a usage update from AWS could still be omitting usage in the hours preceding it. What if I don't pay the renewal invoice before my usage exceeds the Hard Limit? \u00b6 If you do not pay the renewal invoice before you reach the Hard Limit, you will lose access to the Direct Pay account /pd, and you will be unable to launch any workspaces from the Direct Pay account. If you still have not renewed funding 2 months (60 days) after reaching your Hard Limit, we may delete the contents of the /pd for that account. Why is the OCC Payment Portal a separate account? \u00b6 The OCC payment portal is for our third-party AWS reseller, the Open Commons Consortium (OCC). The site is payments.occ-data.org . This is a separate site and account because we want to protect your financial information; the OCC payment portal site follows more rigorous financial best practices. Please note that neither this site nor OCC as an organization will hold any of your payment information; when you pay an invoice, the actual payment information will go through a separate secure payment processor and is not stored anywhere after the charge is processed. Can I change my email address associated with my OCC Payment Portal account? \u00b6 No. Unfortunately, you cannot change the email address associated with your BillingID or OCC Payment Portal account. You can create a new OCC Payment Portal account with another email address, but you will need to request a new BillingID for that account. I didn\u2019t receive my token for the Payment Portal login. \u00b6 It may take a couple minutes to send, but not more than that. Check your spam folder. If you don't see it there, you can request another token by clicking the Request Token button again. My token for the OCC Payment Portal expired \u00b6 You can request another token by clicking Request Token again. How can I find the terms for the Direct Pay billing agreement? \u00b6 When that document is available, it will be posted on the OCC Direct Pay site. We will link to it when available. At what point am I actually paying for workspace funds - what step does the actual charge take place? \u00b6 You designate how much you want to purchase when you initially request your BillingID on the OCC Payment Portal. However, the invoice for this amount is not actually sent until after you have done both of the following: receive a BillingID on the OCC Payment Portal use this BillingID to request a Direct-Pay-funded workspace account in the Workspace Account Manager Once you have completed both of these, you will be sent an invoice - when you pay this invoice is when you submit your credit card number and actually pay the charged amount. What credit cards can be used to pay for Direct Pay? \u00b6 We accept all major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. We also accept ACH electronic payments from a bank account, Apple Pay, PayPal, and Venmo. What are the different websites involved in purchasing and using Direct Pay for workspaces? \u00b6 BRH Platform: This is the main BRH site, with all the BRH data and the Workspace page. The site is brh.data-commons.org , and you can reach the Workspace page by clicking on the Workspace button at the top of the portal. BRH Workspace Account Manager: This is where you can request or view details of your Workspace accounts funded with persistent pay models. The site is brh-portal.org , and you can also reach this site from the BRH Workspace page by clicking on the Workspace Account Manager link at the top left corner, in the Account Information section. This page will be built into the BRH Platform Workspace page in a future update ( i.e. , it won't be a separate page). OCC Payment Portal: This is the payment portal site for our third-party AWS reseller, the Open Commons Consortium (OCC). Here, you can request a BillingID, specify the amount of Direct Pay funding you will want on your Direct Pay account, and track the status of your BillingID request. The site is payments.occ-data.org . Note: Neither this site nor OCC will hold any of your payment information; when you pay an invoice, the actual payment information will go through a separate secure payment processor and is not stored anywhere after the charge is processed. STRIDES Questions \u00b6 What is the STRIDES Program? \u00b6 The NIH STRIDES Initiative is a program to help NIH-funded researchers accelerate biomedical research by reducing barriers to utilizing for-fee cloud services, like the BRH Workspace. The STRIDES program gives cost discounts and a host of other benefits to researchers with NIH grants and contracts. What are the benefits for using the STRIDES program? \u00b6 STRIDES program benefits include: Cost discounts on AWS services (e.g., compute, storage, and egress fees) Premium-level AWS Enterprise Support Training and education programs and more! See the STRIDES program benefits page for more information Who is eligible for using the STRIDES program? \u00b6 Anyone with any NIH funding, for any NIH award type, is eligible for the benefits of the STRIDES Initiative. What is the difference between STRIDES Credit and STRIDES Grant/Award Funded? \u00b6 The main difference is who is responsible for paying to provision the Workspace account. STRIDES Grant/Award Funded: This is the most common STRIDES account model. Here, the Workspace account is provisioned by organization receiving the NIH grant funds (generally a PI's institution). Researchers who have received NIH funding (e.g. a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction agreement) can use these funds for the BRH workspace account. With this option, the researchers' organization will be responsible for payment. STRIDES Credits This is less common. Here, the payment for provisioning the Workspace account is made directly by NIH. Generally this is discussed with NIH ahead of submitting the request. With this option, once the request is approved, a new account with a set spending limit of will be provisioned by NIH directly for usage.","title":"Workspace FAQ"},{"location":"17-workspace_faq/#workspace-faqs","text":"","title":"Workspace FAQs"},{"location":"17-workspace_faq/#workspace-questions-any-funding-source","text":"","title":"Workspace Questions (any funding source)"},{"location":"17-workspace_faq/#what-happens-if-my-trial-access-or-funding-runs-out","text":"When you have used all of your allotted time (trial access) or funding (persistent pay models), you will no longer be able to launch a workspace.
