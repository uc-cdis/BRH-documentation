The platform provides a way to search and query over study metadata and diverse data types, generated by different projects and organizations, and stored across multiple secure repositories. The BRH also offers a secure and cost-effective cloud-computing environment for data analysis, empowering collaborative research and development of new analytical tools. New workflows and results of analyses can be shared with the community. The BRH is powered by the open-source software \u201cGen3\u201d .
